subsystem of Cisco&nbsp;IOS Software and Cisco&nbsp;IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service&nbsp;(DoS) condition.</p>\r\n<p>The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted TACACS+ response packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted TACACS+ packet into an existing TACACS+ session between an affected device and a TACACS+ server or by impersonating a known, valid TACACS+ server and sending a crafted TACACS+ packet to an affected device when establishing a connection to the device. To exploit this vulnerability by using either method, the attacker must know the shared TACACS+ secret and the crafted packet must be sent in response to a TACACS+ request from a TACACS+ client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</p>\r\n<p>There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\r\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-tacplus\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-tacplus</a></p>"},{"advisoryId":"cisco-sa-20180926-privesc","advisoryTitle":"Cisco IOS XE Software Privileged EXEC Mode Root Shell Access Vulnerability","bugIDs":["CSCuw45594"],"ipsSignatures":["NA"],"cves":["CVE-2018-15368"],"cvrfUrl":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-privesc/cvrf/cisco-sa-20180926-privesc_cvrf.xml","cvssBaseScore":"6.7","cwe":["CWE-78"],"firstPublished":"2018-09-26T16:00:00","lastUpdated":"2018-09-26T16:00:00","status":"Final","version":"1.0","productNames":["Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.5S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.6S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.7S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.8S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.4aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.2tS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.0bS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.1aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.8.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.8.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.8.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.9.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.9.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.9.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.9.1aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.9.0aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.5S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.6S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.2aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.10.2tS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.11.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.11.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.11.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.11.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.11.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.12.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.12.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.12.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.12.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.12.0aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.12.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.2aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.13.0aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.14.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.14.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.14.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.14.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.14.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.15.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.15.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.15.2S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.15.1cS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.15.3S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.15.4S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.16.0S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.16.1S","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.16.0aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.16.1aS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.16.0bS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.16.0cS","Cisco IOS XE Software 3.17.0S"],"publicationUrl":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-privesc","sir":"Medium","summary":"<p>A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco&nbsp;IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of an affected device and execute arbitrary commands with <em>root</em> privileges on the device.</p>\r\n<p>The vulnerability is due to the affected software improperly sanitizing command arguments to prevent modifications to the underlying Linux filesystem on a device.

These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged, local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes.\r\n<p>The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-3615, affects Intel SGX technology and is referred to by the researchers who discovered it as <em>foreshadow. </em>This vulnerability is not known to affect any Cisco devices as the Cisco devices do not utilize Intel SGX technology. </p>\r\n<p>The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-3620, and the third vulnerability, CVE-2018-3646, are referred to as <em>L1 Terminal Fault</em> attacks by Intel. These two vulnerabilities affect multi-core processors that leverage Intel Hyper-Threading technology supporting Operating System, System Management Mode, and Virtualized workloads. Like the previously disclosed Spectre vulnerabilities, all three new vulnerabilities leverage cache-timing attacks to infer any disclosed data.</p>\r\n<p>To exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted or script code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector from which to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as the operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted.

This is not a new vulnerability or a new attack against these protocols. This is a new vector that allows an attacker to obtain the information required to attempt an offline attack against the PSK.</p>\r\n<p>This new method is different from the existing attacks against the PSK because it does not require an attacker to wait for an Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) authentication exchange, capture it, and proceed to attempt an offline PSK recovery. This new vector allows an attacker to extract the required information from a single wireless frame transmitted during a roaming event. The following conditions for this capture apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The frame contains a Robust Security Network-Pairwise Master Key Identification (RSN-PMKID) option</li>\r\n    <li>The wireless infrastructure is configured to use WPA2 with a PSK mode of authentication</li>\r\n    <li>The wireless infrastructure supports the Proactive Key Caching (PKC) fast roaming option (PMKID roaming)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe wireless frame can be acquired by passively listening to traffic from the wireless network during the roaming.<br />\r\n<p>It is important to note that this method does not make it easier or faster to recover the PSK for a Wi-Fi network. Instead, it is easier for an attacker to collect the information required to conduct a subsequent offline cryptographic attack.

(BGP) implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the device unexpectedly reloading.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxosbgp\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxosbgp</a></p>\r\n<p>This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities.

Cisco&nbsp;Fabric Services&nbsp;(CFS) component of Cisco&nbsp;FXOS Software and Cisco&nbsp;NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.</p>\r\n<p>The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packet headers when the software processes packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the device, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Cisco&nbsp;Fabric Services component of Cisco&nbsp;FXOS Software and Cisco&nbsp;NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service&nbsp;(DoS) condition on an affected device.</p>\r\n<p>The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packets when the software processes packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the device, which could cause process crashes and result in a DoS condition on the device.</p></p>\r\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\r\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br><a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nx-os-fabric-services-dos\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nx-os-fabric-services-dos</a></p>\r\n<p><p>This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged, local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes.</p>\r\n<p>The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-3639, is known as <em>Spectre Variant 4</em> or <em>SpectreNG</em>. The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-3640, is known as <em>Spectre Variant 3a</em>. Both of these attacks are variants of the attacks disclosed in January 2018 and leverage cache-timing attacks to infer any disclosed data.</p>\r\n<p>To exploit either of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted or script code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.</p>\r\n<p>A Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.</p>\r\n<p>Although Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted. Refer to the &ldquo;Affected Products&rdquo; section of this advisory for information about the impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco cloud services.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

subsystem of Cisco&nbsp;IOS Software and Cisco&nbsp;IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service&nbsp;(DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds for most affected Cisco products that address this vulnerability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-qos\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-qos</a><br />\r\n<p><p>This advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS and IOS&nbsp;XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities.

</strong>After further investigation, Cisco has identified additional attack vectors and features that are affected by this vulnerability. In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the <a href=\"#fixed\">Fixed Software</a> section for more information. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<hr />\r\n<br />\r\nA vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that&nbsp; the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory  when processing a malicious XML payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface on an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo be vulnerable the ASA must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface.

These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes or memory allocated to  the operating system kernel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first two vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715,  are collectively known as <em>Spectre</em>. The third vulnerability, CVE-2017-5754, is known as <em>Meltdown</em>. The vulnerabilities are all variants of the same attack and differ in the way that speculative execution is exploited. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted.
