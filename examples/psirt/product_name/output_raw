Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) feature of Cisco&nbsp;FXOS Software, Cisco&nbsp;IOS Software, Cisco&nbsp;IOS XE Software, Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software, and Cisco&nbsp;NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload.</p>\r\n<p>This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the UDLD packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically crafted UDLD packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>The UDLD feature is disabled by default, and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict. An attacker must have full control of a directly connected device. On Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR devices, the impact is limited to the reload of the UDLD process.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

released a security advisory detailing seven vulnerabilities and a new attack, referred to as the <em>Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN)</em> attack. A total of eight Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were assigned. Of the eight CVEs, three relate to the DROWN attack. The remaining CVEs track low severity vulnerabilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDROWN is a cross-protocol attack that actively exploits weaknesses in SSL Version 2 (SSLv2) to decrypt passively collected Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions. DROWN does not exploit a vulnerability in the TLS protocol or any specific implementation of the protocol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo execute a successful DROWN attack, the attacker must identify a server that supports both SSLv2 and TLS, and uses the same RSA key pair for both protocols. The attacker must also be able to collect TLS traffic for the server.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160302-openssl\">http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160302-openssl</a>"},{"advisoryId":"cisco-sa-20160428-ntpd","advisoryTitle":"Multiple Vulnerabilities in Network Time Protocol Daemon Affecting Cisco Products: April 2016","bugIDs":["CSCuz44082","CSCuz44085","CSCuz44088","CSCuz44101","CSCuz44110","CSCuz44113","CSCuz44114","CSCuz44116","CSCuz44119","CSCuz44136","CSCuz44140","CSCuz44142","CSCuz44144","CSCuz44145","CSCuz44147","CSCuz44149","CSCuz44152","CSCuz44158","CSCuz44160","CSCuz44169","CSCuz44175","CSCuz44185","CSCuz44186","CSCuz44194","CSCuz44196","CSCuz44201","CSCuz44204","CSCuz44208","CSCuz44220","CSCuz44221","CSCuz44222","CSCuz44223","CSCuz44225","CSCuz44228","CSCuz44232","CSCuz44235","CSCuz44236","CSCuz44237","CSCuz44246","CSCuz44250","CSCuz44253","CSCuz44257","CSCuz44259","CSCuz44263","CSCuz44269","CSCuz44271","CSCuz44289","CSCuz44290","CSCuz44292","CSCuz44297","CSCuz44298","CSCuz44332","CSCuz44348","CSCuz44356","CSCuz44368","CSCuz44380","CSCuz44381","CSCuz44383","CSCuz44388","CSCuz44390","CSCuz44391","CSCuz44393","CSCuz44394","CSCuz44403","CSCuz44415","CSCuz44439","CSCuz45517","CSCuz46598","CSCuz47492"],"ipsSignatures":["NA"],"cves":["CVE-2015-7704","CVE-2015-8138","CVE-2016-1547","CVE-2016-1548","CVE-2016-1549","CVE-2016-1550","CVE-2016-1551","CVE-2016-2516","CVE-2016-2517","CVE-2016-2518","CVE-2016-2519"],"cvrfUrl":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160428-ntpd/cvrf/cisco-sa-20160428-ntpd_cvrf.xml","cvssBaseScore":"NA","cwe":["NA"],"firstPublished":"2016-04-28T09:00:00","lastUpdated":"2016-05-13T15:48:00","status":"Interim","version":"1.10","productNames":["Cisco Application and Content Networking System (ACNS) Software ","Cisco Unity ","Cisco Prime Access Registrar ","Cisco Emergency Responder ","Cisco IOS XR Software ","Cisco Unity Express ","Cisco NAC Appliance Software ","Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) ","Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module ","Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) ","Cisco IP Interoperability and Collaboration System (IPICS) ","Cisco Unity Connection ","Cisco TelePresence ","Cisco Physical Access Gateway  ","Cisco IOS XE Software ","Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server Software ","Cisco Digital Media Manager Software ","Cisco MeetingPlace Server ","Cisco Network Analysis Module (NAM) Software ","Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance ","Cisco Network Admission Control Guest Server ","Cisco Show and Share ","Cisco Identity Services Engine Software ","Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) ","Cisco ASA CX Context-Aware Security Software ","Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM) ","Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) ","Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution (LMS) ","Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager ","Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) ","Cisco Prime Infrastructure ","Cisco Connected Grid Network Management System (CG-NMS) ","Cisco WebEx Node for MCS ","Cisco Unified Computing System Central Software ","Cisco Enterprise Content Delivery System (ECDS) ","Cisco Virtualization Experience Media Engine ","Cisco MediaSense ","Cisco Unified SIP Proxy ","Cisco UCS Director ","Cisco Videoscape Distribution Suite Transparent Caching (VDS TC)  ","Cisco Digital Content Manager (DCM) Software ","Cisco Prime Service Catalog ","Cisco Nexus 1000V Switch  ","Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) ","Cisco Expressway ","Cisco Jabber Guest ","Cisco Visual Quality Experience ","Cisco Prime License Manager ","Cisco onePK All-in-One Virtual Machine ","Cisco Prime Network Services Controller ","Cisco TelePresence ISDN Link ","Cisco Telepresence Conductor ","Cisco Firepower System Software ","Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance ","Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning ","Cisco Paging Server ","Cisco D9036 Modular Encoding Platform ","Cisco Videoscape Control Suite ","Cisco Small Business Video Surveillance Cameras Firmware ","Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS) ","Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switch ","Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment ","Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100  ","Cisco Registered Envelope Service "],"publicationUrl":"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160428-ntpd","sir":"Medium","summary":"Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) package.
