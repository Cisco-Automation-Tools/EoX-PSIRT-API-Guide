An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\r\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sna-xss-NXOxDhRQ\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sna-xss-NXOxDhRQ</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Attention</strong>: Simplifying the Cisco&nbsp;portfolio includes the renaming of security products under one brand: Cisco&nbsp;Secure.
