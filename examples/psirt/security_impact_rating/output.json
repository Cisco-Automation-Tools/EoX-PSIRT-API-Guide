An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large amounts of traffic that would be subject to NAT and rate limiting through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the QuantumFlow Processor utilization to reach 100 percent on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to connect to the device with a non-AnyConnect client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the IP addresses from the assigned local pool, which prevents users from logging in and leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.</p>\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br><a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev2-ebFrwMPr\" target=\"_blank\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev2-ebFrwMPr</a></p>\n\n<p>This advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

An attacker with low privileges could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the diagnostic CLI <strong><span class=\"synph\"><span class=\"kwd\">show pnp profile</span></span></strong> when a specific PnP listener is enabled on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain a privileged authentication token. This token can be used to send crafted PnP messages and execute privileged commands on the targeted system.</p>\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on the adjacent subnet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect an unauthorized server to the infrastructure VLAN, which is highly privileged. With a connection to the infrastructure VLAN, the attacker can make unauthorized connections to Cisco&nbsp;Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) services or join other host endpoints.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\r\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br><a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n9kaci-unauth-access-5PWzDx2w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n9kaci-unauth-access-5PWzDx2w</a></p>\r\n<p>This advisory is part of the February 2021 Cisco&nbsp;FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted IPv6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the network stack to run out of available buffers, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols and resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention would be required to restore normal operations on the affected device.</p>\r\n<p>For more information about the impact of this vulnerability, see the <a href=\"#details\">Details</a> section of this advisory.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
