Version 2 (IKEv2) support for the AutoReconnect feature of Cisco&nbsp;IOS Software and Cisco&nbsp;IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the free IP addresses from the assigned local pool.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability occurs because the code does not release the allocated IP address under certain failure conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to connect to the device with a non-AnyConnect client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the IP addresses from the assigned local pool, which prevents users from logging in and leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.</p>\n<p>Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br><a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev2-ebFrwMPr\" target=\"_blank\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev2-ebFrwMPr</a></p>\n\n<p>This advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
